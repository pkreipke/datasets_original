## Usage Notes
- Download or fork here for the original version of the dataset as we have received it
- If there is a dataset you want that we do not have, please open an issue, and ideally describe what you know about such data: any ideas on how opening the dataset can benefit the community, ideas for sources that already maintain such information and could open it, etc.
- If a cleaned or reformatted version of a dataset we do already have doesn't yet exist open an issue in the respective project repo or help us out by cleaning/reformatting and submit a pull request to the project repo.
